  Enforce that all TypeScript interfaces are declared in the `types/` directory
  to keep domain types centralized and reusable across the app.

- Place all `interface` declarations in files under `types/` (e.g., `types/api.ts`, `types/state.ts`).
- Do not declare interfaces inside `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, or `backend/` files; import them from `types/` instead.
- For component-only shapes, prefer a local `type` alias. When a shape is shared across files, promote it to an `interface` in `types/` and import it where used.
- Use named exports for interfaces in `types/` to keep modules tree-shake friendly; avoid default exports.
